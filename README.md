# EicRoot

//
//   EicRoot - EIC detector simulation software based on FairRoot framework.
//
//
//    Read INSTALL file for installation instructions. 
//
//    Look through "examples" directories for simple usage examples. These examples
// should be sufficient to create EicRoot-friendly tracking and basic calorimeter 
// devices which can then be passed through the simplified  
// simulation->digitization->reconstruction chain. For now digitization and 
// track reconstruction use idealized algorithms, which are however useful at least 
// for resolution studies.
