  root -l calorimeter.C -> !!! run it first to produce calorimeter.root input file !!!
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Script used to create a custom calorimeter geometry ("flat" NxN crystal matrix
in this case; see geometry/FEMC, geometry/BEMC, geometry/CEMC for more 
advanced cases). Pay attention to the logical mapping table creation, which 
establishes a one-to-one relationship between multi-dimensional node indices in 
GEANT tree and XY-indices on the map (which is trivial in this simple example, 
but may look like {quadrant#1,alveole#33,crystal#2} -> {X=2,Y=31} for BEMC 
implementation).
