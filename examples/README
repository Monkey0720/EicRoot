   A collection of working example scripts, which are supposed to illustrate the 
EicRoot usage scheme. Typically the flow of actions is

  0) Do not forget to declare environment variables:

    .      <eicroot_build_directory>/config.sh    (bash)
    source <eicroot_build_directory>/config.csh   (C-shell)

  1) Run whatever scripts needed to create local TGeo geometry files (optional; see 
README in respective directories);

  2)  root -l simulation.C
 
    - run GEANT simulation (typically 1000 events with a single pion or electron track);
    - produce simulation.root file with the MC hits;

  2a) root -l eventDisplay.C

    - browse generated events using ROOT event display;

  3)  root -l digitization.C

    - import simulation.root;
    - digitize MC hits;
    - produce digitization.root file with the digitized (say smeared) hits;

  4)  root -l reconstruction.C

    - import simulation.root & digitization.root;
    - depending on the example, reconstruct tracks, calorimeter clusters, etc;
    - produce reconstruction.root with reconstructed objects;

  5) root -l analysis.C

    - import simulation.root & reconstruction.root;
    - produce some trivial histograms for reconstructed data inspection;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  calorimetry -> few calorimeter applications:
    config.1 - basic simplified crystal calorimeter geometry; electron energy reconstruction;
    config.2 - realistic HCal geometry; pion energy reconstruction; 

  physics     -> few examples with PYTHIA input file analysis; tracking only for now; 
    config.1 - X_bj smearing plot construction on PYTHIA input file events;
    config.2 - kinematic variable smearing and {x,Q^2} migration plots on PYTHIA events;

  tracking    -> several tracking examples;
    config.1 - a simplistic forward detector (silicon disks in magnetic field);
    config.2 - a more advanced silicon vertex + TPC tracker;
    config.3 - a complete BeAST tracker simulation;
    config.4 - simplified ePHENIX forward tracker setup;
